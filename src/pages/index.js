        Hi! My name is Marcin. I live in Warsaw, Poland, and this page is a
        cross between a business card and a portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got my education in teaching English as a foreign language, and worked
        as an English teacher for five years. Since 2017 I've worked as a
        Technical Writer (currently at{' '}
        <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>), creating online
        documentation for software.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, I've volunteered at a non-profit, where I organized
        youth camps and weekend workshops, leading educational exercises on
        human rights, diversity, sustainable development, and peaceful conflict
        resolution. I've also co‑organized{' '}
        <a href="https://www.pylight.org/">PyLight Waw</a>, a beginner‑friendly
        Python meetup and have given talks on software documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter my future job title, I'm a{' '}
        <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/documentarians/">documentarian</a>
        , a person who cares about documentation and communication in the
        software industry. I'd like to learn more about software UX and
        designing experiences in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care about open-source software, the welfare of humans and other
        animals, and, broadly speaking, building bridges not walls.
